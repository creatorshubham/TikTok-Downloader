# TikTok-Downloader
Simple Open Source App to Download TikTok Videos using share feature of the App.

The idea is that some of the videos cannot be downloaded within the app, or one simply doesn't want tiktok grant access to external storage, but they can be downloaded from the Website. This small project automates that process, by levreging the share / other feature of the TikTok app.

There is already plenty of applications in the Play Store doing the same so this is not released. Probably won't be updated as often as they are. However feel free to look over the inner workings of the code if your heath desires.

If you wish to try it out, here is the QR code to download the application.
